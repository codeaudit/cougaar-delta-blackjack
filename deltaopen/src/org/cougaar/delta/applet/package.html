Provides classes used by the RuleEditApplet. The applet is spawned by the RuleEditServlet, providing a UI for creating new rules and editing existing rules. Rule conditions and exceptions can be created. The UI displays choices for candidate characteristics that can be used to make qualification rules. For comparisons to literal values, the user can input specific values. The applet is accessed from the RuleEditServlet's rule summary page using the create new rule button or from the RuleEditServlet's rule detail page using the rule edit button.
