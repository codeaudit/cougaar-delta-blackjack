Provides classes for reading and writing formatted text data files.  While standard Java classes can read delimited text files, no facilities are available to read formatted data that uses no delimiters.  Each line in a text file constitutes a record (i.e., records are separated by newline characters), and, within each record, fields are defined based on their character position in the line.  For example, the field named "foo" could be defined as those characters in record positions 1-3.  The classes in this package allow the programmer to define custom file formats, record formats, and field formats so that any formatted text file can be read or written.  Note that "files" are made up of one or more "records", and records are made up of one or more "fields".  The format of each of these components (files, records, and fields) can be defined using the appropriate classes in this package.  The classes also provide methods for reading and writing these formatted files.
<p>
These classes depend on the following system properties:
<p>
<i>org.cougaar.install.path</i>: the path to the top level installation directory of the Cougaar files<br>
<i>org.cougaar.delta.data.path</i>: the path to where data files are stored
<p>
These properties can be set when the Cougaar node is run by including the following arguments with the java.exe command:
<p>
-Dorg.cougaar.install.path=(enter the path to the top level installation directory)<br>
-Dorg.cougaar.delta.data.path=(enter the path to the data directory)
