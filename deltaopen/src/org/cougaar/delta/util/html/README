Package org.cougaar.delta.util.html

This package provides classes for constructing HTML pages to display various 
types of data. There are three basic types of HTML pages that can be 
constructed by the classes in this package:  

  - Pre-built pages based on template files
  - Summary pages;
  - Detail pages.

Pre-built pages
These are nearly-complete HTML files ("template files") where the static parts 
of the page are pre-built, while the changeable data appears as a field
name surrounded by double pound signs ("##").  A servlet would 
use the classes TemplateProcessor, EncodingTemplate, and/or FormTemplate to 
replace the delimited field names with actual data.

Summary pages
Multiple records (from a database query, for example) can be displayed using
summary pages, where record data is formatted into tables diplaying 
multiple records, one row per record.  Field names, which are selectable, 
comprise the columns, and records can be sorted based on any user-specified
column.  Individual data elements can be hyperlinked to other data pages.  
A servlet would use the class UniversalTable to construct a summary page.

Detail pages
Detail pages display a single record, with each row representing a single
field/data element by name and value.  Class UniversalDetail represents a 
single page (record). Data is arranged on the page in sections using class 
UniversalDetailSection (and its subclasses) and, within each section, by 
item (i.e., row or data element) using class UniversalDetailItem (and its 
subclasses).  As with the summary pages, individual items can be hyperlinked.

By mixing and matching these three type pages and their components, a wide
range of page designs may be created.  For example, a UniversalTable can be
added to a pre-built page, allowing for a search form at the top
and a table of records retrieved by the search at the bottom.

Content to appear on the above pages is typically passed to the appropriate 
class as part of a DataWrapper object (in package org.cougaar.delta.util.variant).  
A DataWrapper simply wraps any type of input object so that it may be passed 
to any of the various html-generating classes, which are expecting objects of 
type DataWrapper.  This wrapper class also provides methods that allow a 
programmer to set and extract various properties of the wrapped object.

This information is also available in the package-level Javadoc.
