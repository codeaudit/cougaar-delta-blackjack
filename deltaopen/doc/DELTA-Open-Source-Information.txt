DELTA Open Source Module

The DELTA Open source module contains components from
DELTA/BlackJack that may be of general use. These components
are described briefly below.  

NOTICE:
All of these modules have been tested against the Cougaar
9.0 release.  Although most of these components should be fully
compatible with Cougaar 9.2 itself, there may be some conversions
required because of the JDK 1.3 -> 1.4 transition in Cougaar 9.2.


Rule Editor and Rule Engine

Rules are used to qualify candidate objects using the JESS rule
engine. In the example provided, candidates for a loan are assigned
either negative, neutral, or positive qualifications by using rules
that check candidate characteristics.  The rule module includes an
object representation for rules, a database table schema for rule
storage, functionality for importing/exporting rules as xml, an
applet-based rule editor, and a sample plugin that uses the rules to
qualify some sample candidates using JESS. See the
org.cougaar.delta.util.qrule package for more information on the rule
representation, and the org.cougaar.delta.applet package for more
information on the editor applet. Instructions for setting up this
module and running the sample plugins are in the RuleModuleReadme
file.


Universal HTML Tables

This module provides functionality for displaying tabular results
as HTML tables. See the org.cougaar.delta.util.html package for
details. The OpenRuleEdit servlet is an example that uses universal
HTML tables. Sort by column, links, and tooltip messages are supported.


FileIO

This package provides classes for reading and writing 
formatted text data files.  See the org.cougaar.delta.fileio package.


Demand Viewer

See the org.cougaar.blackjack.applet.demandviewer package contained in
the separate BlackJackOpen distribution.
